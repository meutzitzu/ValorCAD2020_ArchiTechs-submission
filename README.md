# ValorCAD2020_ArchiTechs-submission

ongoing development for a differential swerve-drive 

IMPORTANT: Uses Assembly3, an experimental assembly workbench on realthunder's development branch which has not yet been merged into the main FreeCAD. Opening the files in this repository with the regular version of FreeCAD will not work for now. You may still view the geometry of the parts and bodies and export for 3D printing or CNC milling but if you want to manipulate the assembly you have to download the aforementioned development branch.
